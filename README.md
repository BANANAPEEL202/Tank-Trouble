## Power Ups
### Machine Gun
Shoots a rapid volley of bullets at your enemies. Brrrt!
### Shotgun
Slam your enemies with bullets covering a wide area. Shotgun bullets last less than regular bullets. 
### Laser
An instantaneous shot of pure energy that kills anything in its dotted path. Basically aimbot. 
### Missile
> The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't.

Automatically tracks the nearest tank (even if its the tank that fired it). Your only chance of survival is to outrun this beast. 
### Death Beam
Miniaturized death star technology. This beam of plasma is naturally attracted to the metal of tanks and goes through everything in its path (including walls).
### Frag Bomb
Click once to fire. Click twice to detonate.
